Enrollment Demographics: Gender
################################

What is the gender balance in my course? Knowing the male-female ratio in your
course can help you understand who is enrolling in your course and whether the
balance changes over time.

Student demographic data is updated every day to include changes in enrollment
through 23:59 UTC the previous day.

Gaining Insight into Student Gender
********************************************

Students can identify themselves with a gender by selecting **Female**,
**Male**, or **Other** when they register for an account on edx.org or
edge.edx.org. Student gender data is provided in a chart and a report that you
can view or download. Descriptions follow; for detailed information about the
computations, see
:ref:`Reference`.

======================================
Self-Reported Student Gender Chart
======================================

The bars on this chart represent the percentage of enrolled learners who
reported a gender of **Female**, **Male**, or **Other**. Moving your cursor
over the chart shows the percentage for that gender, calculated to one decimal
place.

Student gender data is also available for review in tabular format and can be
downloaded.

.. An example of this chart follows.

.. The chart reveals %%. The team for this course might %%.

.. any suggestions for an interesting-looking chart, and how it moght be interpreted as shopwing the success or failure of a marketing effort, would be much appreciated.

See the :ref:`Reference` for a detailed description of how student gender
values are computed.

======================================
Gender Breakdown Over Time Report 
======================================

The daily total enrollment count with gender breakdown is available for review
or download. Columns show each date, the total enrollment on that date, and
breakdown columns for the number of people who reported each gender category
and who did not provide this information at registration.

To download the Gender Breakdown Over Time report in a comma-separated value
file, click **Download CSV**. The CSV file contains the following columns:

* course_id
* created (the date and time of the computation)
* date
* female
* male
* other
* unknown

===============================================
Researching an Unanticipated Disparity
===============================================

Not long before launch, the team for a programming MOOC checked the
demographics for the students who had enrolled. They were completely surprised
by the extent of the gender imbalance, which was far more acute than they had
ever seen in their on-campus version of the class.

The team looked into possible contributing factors, and realized that the
audiences of the journal articles and blog posts that had been written about
the course skewed heavily male. They also reread the course About page to see
if it represented the course differently than they had intended.

Even more important to the team than finding potential causes was to make an
effort to enroll more women in the course. To do so, they reached out to
professional womenâ€™s organizations for guidance on ways to market the course to
their members. (With edX Insights, the team could monitor the success of this
effort by checking the enrollment trend for women in the CSV file.)
