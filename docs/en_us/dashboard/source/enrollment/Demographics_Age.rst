Enrollment Demographics: Age
#############################

How old are my students? Awareness of the ages reported by your students can
help you understand whether a target audience is enrolled in your course.

Student demographic data is updated every day to include changes in enrollment
through the end of the previous day (23:59 UTC).

********************************************
Gaining Insight into Student Age
********************************************

Students can report a year of birth when they register for an account on
edx.org or edge.edx.org. Student ages, derived from year of birth, are provided
in a chart, a set of metrics, and a report that you can view or download.
Descriptions follow; for detailed information about the computations, see
:ref:`Reference`.

======================================
Self-Reported Student Age Chart
======================================

Each bar on this chart represents the total number of enrolled learners who are
a given age, based on reported year of birth. Moving your cursor over the chart
shows a tool tip with the %%% for each day.

The chart includes every reported age. This data is also available for review
in tabular format and can be downloaded.

.. A couple of examples of this chart follow for different courses. The first example shows the age distribution for an Advanced Placement (AP) course. 

.. .. image:: ../images/age_chart_AP.png
.. :alt: 

.. AP courses are designed to be taken by students of high school age. The chart reveals a wider distribution of reported ages, but confirms that most students are teenagers.

.. The second example shows the Self-Reported Student Age chart for a MOOC.

.. .. image:: ../images/age_chart_MOOC.png
.. :alt: 

.. This chart shows a wider age distribution, including reports of age 0 and 100+. To gain a more accurate understanding of the ages of the students in the course, the course team might add a survey to the first week of the course.

See the :ref:`Reference` chapter for a detailed description of how edX computes
student age values.

======================================
Median Age Statistic
======================================
  
This statistic indicates that half of the students in your course who reported
their ages are younger, and half older, than the value that is shown.

======================================
Age Band Metrics
======================================
  
Three age ranges, or bands, are provided to give you a different at-a-glance
perspective of the distribution of student ages. The percentage of students  in
each band is shown.

======================================
Age Breakdown Report 
======================================

The number of students reporting each age, through the date of the last update,
is available for review or download. The report includes a row for each age,
with columns for **Number of Students** and **Percentage**. The report also
includes a row for enrolled students who did not supply this data.

To download the Age Breakdown report in a comma-separated value file,
click **Download CSV**. The CSV file contains the following columns: 

* birth_year
* count
* course_id
* created (the date and time of the computation)
* date

Analytics in Action: Interpreting the Age Distribution

===========================
Learning for the Fun of It
===========================

For the professor of a computer science MOOC, students in the 41+ age band were
a target audience from the inception of the course. This professor used this
age band to represent the group of people who take online courses for the
pleasure of learning something new, rather than to pass exams or gain
credentials. The professor designed the course as self-paced, believing it made
more sense for those students than a schedule of regular deadlines.

To find out whether they had successfully attracted the audience that they
wanted to, the course team checked the age distribution of the students who
enrolled in the course.
