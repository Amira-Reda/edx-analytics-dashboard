.. note:: Performance testing is currently in progress for the learner
  activity feature. While this testing is in progress, this feature is
  available to a limited number of users at a given time.

You can access information about what individual learners are doing in your
course, and how frequently: from the edX Insights menu select **Learners**. A
report of the key activity metrics for all enrolled learners appears, including
problems tried and videos played. You can then review a chart of individual
learner activity over time by selecting a learner by username.
